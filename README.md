## **`DEPLOYMENT & USAGE`**
> 1️⃣ **Step 01**: Please visit the Original Repository [**`AutoQPGen 2.0`**](https://github.com/azuregray/AutoQPGen-2.0) and find the Green `CODE` button and click on "Download ZIP".  
> or just [**`Click here to download`**](https://github.com/azuregray/AutoQPGen-2.0/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

> 2️⃣ **Step 02**: Extract the downloaded `AutoQPGen-main.zip` file into its folder and open the same.

> 3️⃣ **Step 03**: Once you are in the folder, Install the requirements.  
> To take the help of `requirements.txt`, just run this in Terminal:  
> `Interpreter: PowerShell`
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 4️⃣ **Step 04**: It is required to have Microsoft Office installed on the server machine that hosts the folder.  
> This is important for question paper functionalities as it uses on-device MSO365 service for all the conversion and substitution functionalities.

> 5️⃣ **Step 05**: Next thing to be focused on is to install the very important NER Model for SpaCy. Just run this in the Terminal:  
> `Interpreter: PowerShell`
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

> 6️⃣ **Step 06**: Once that is successful, finally run `app.py` in Terminal:  
> `Interpreter: PowerShell`
```
python ./app.py
```

> 7️⃣ **Step 07**: After running the command in `Step 06`, please do a `Ctrl + Click` on the localhost URL where the service is being hosted, which is generated in the same terminal windows running `app.py`.  
> For example: `https://127.0.0.1:5000`

### **`CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR QUESTION BANK CREATION`**
> You can find the official Question Bank format that AutoQPGen supports at `/Assets/SampleQuestionBanks/Template/`

> **`01`** - It is highly recommended that you use the provided Template DOCX file to make new Question Banks.  

> **`02`** - Make sure you have either a period "." or a Closed Paranthesis ")" immediately next to Sl. No. in each row.  

> **`03`** - It is recommended to not have any extra text in between the pages / tables / rows as that may interfere with the data extraction.  

> **`04`** - It is important that CO and Levels column entries are accompanied by prefixes such as "CO" and "L" respectively.  

> **`05`** - You can have as many question as you like per module but just make sure all the entries are filled to avoid unintended errors.  

> **`06`** - Be very cautious to ensure that each question bank has not more than TWO modules.  

> **`07`** - AutoQPGen system gives priority to the Module field in each row rather than the sub-header that is mentioned before each table so make sure that is filled to ensure your question ends up in the right module.

> **`08`** - As the system is text-based, Diagrams or Figures or Images in Question Bank are currently not supported.  

> **`09`** - Please note that, we stand against any changes to Question Bank elements other than the three dots "..." when using the provided template, and take no responsibility if the question bank deems to be unsupported as a result of these actions.  

> **`10`** - It is equally important to note that "Faculty:" is the correct field name for faculty detail in input Question Bank.     

> **`11`** - It is recommended to enable borders the hidden table structure for the pre-details such as Subject, Sem & Faculty Details section and then re-disable the borders for the same after desired edits.

### **`A SMALL NOTE`**
> As for the scope of the project, we have only included only One variant of question paper template in `/static/DocxTemplates`.  

> Any new templates or change in template here may require corresponding changes in `/models/DocxDownloader.py` and a user-side mechanism for selection of desired Question Paper template out of the available ones at runtime during question bank creation.
